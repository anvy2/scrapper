        "title": "Gurugram: Protest over new tower, M3M says got govt approval ",
        "body": "GURUGRAM: Residents of M3M Merlin in Sector 67 have launched a unique banner campaign to protest against the developer. Alleging that the developer illegally obtained approval for constructing an extra tower in the society, residents have hung banners from their balconies cautioning prospective home buyers from investing in the project. The builder, M3M Group, has refuted the claims. \u201cThe construction of the 11th tower in M3M Merlin has been announced after all approvals were granted by the authorities. Residents have been attempting to stop the sale of flats in the new towers and are creating groups, which is illegal. M3M has deputed a specialised team to address all residents\u2019 issues, and they are being responded diligently and attended to,\u201d a representative of the builder said. Residents, meanwhile, alleged that the developer obtained approval from the DTCP illegally without the consent of the existing owners, which is mandatory. \u201cWe are objecting because the existing infrastructure is already overburdened and a new tower would only add to the society\u2019s woes,\u201d a resident said. Residents further alleged that the builder has transferred the entire corpus of interest-free maintenance security and other funds, amounting to several crores, to a facility management company it indirectly controls. They expressed concerns that the money will be diverted or siphoned off. \u201cResidents are already being charged very high maintenance fees without adequate services. The account audits aren\u2019t shared with residents, and the builder is running the society with a dummy RWA. Now, they have planned construction of tower 11 without the residents\u2019 consent,\u201d said Devender Singh Sethi, a retired bank official and resident. Another homebuyer, JK Tyagi, who is a retired government official, said the developer doesn\u2019t pay heed to residents\u2019 concerns. \u201cHe made false promises while selling the flats. Once sold, he cleverly pulled out. Such an experience is very painful at this advanced age,\u201d he said. Residents said they are planning to take legal recourse against the builder, as it has failed to resolve encroachments on public property as well, putting their security at grave risk. \u201cResidents put their hard-earned money into buying a house, but it seems they have been taken for a ride by the developer. The society already suffers from seepage problems and poor maintenance, and the builder doesn\u2019t share expenditure details while charging high maintenance fees at the same time. Now, M3M has launched an extra tower without residents' consent,\u201d said Veenu Vashishtha, another resident. District town planner RS Batth said he has not received any complaint in this regard, action will be taken as per the norms if any complaint is given by the residents.  ",

        "title": "England's Tommy Fleetwood returns to golf after four months off ",
        "body": "WASHINGTON: Britain's Tommy Fleetwood, a major runner-up in 2018 and 2019, makes his return to golf after a four-month coronavirus pandemic layoff on Thursday at the US PGA 3M Open. The 29-year-old Englishman, second to Ireland's Shane Lowry by six strokes in the 2019 British Open at Portrush, tees off Thursday morning at TPC Twin Cities in Blaine, Minnesota. Fleetwood, who will play alongside fourth-ranked American Dustin Johnson and rising US star Tony Finau in the first two rounds, also finished second at the 2018 US Open, one stroke behind Brooks Koepka at Shinnecock Hills. This will be the first start since March for Fleetwood, a five-time European Tour winner who grabbed his first 54-hole lead on the US PGA Tour at the Honda Classic four months ago. Needing a birdie at the 72nd hole to force a playoff with South Kore's Im Sung-jae, Fleetwood went for the green in two at the par-5 hole and found the water, closing with a bogey to finish third. Since then, he has spent the tour hiatus at home in England with wife Clare and his 2-year-old son Frankie. \"It has been beautiful family time,\" Fleetwood said. \"It would have been nice if sort of the time we had would have come under different circumstances in the world at the moment, but for us, the time we had together has been something that probably we'll never get again.\" Fleetwood left his family behind when he flew to New York two weeks ago and spent his mandatory 14-day quarantine in the Hamptons on eastern Long Island, returning to Shinnecock among other golf tuneup stops. He built a schedule for a nine-week run of US events that included next month's PGA Championship, the US Open in September and the now-postponed Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits. Fleetwood's new plan includes making a deep run in the US PGA playoffs and finish with the US Open at Winged Foot on September 17-20. \"Really happy to be here,\" Fleetwood said. \"Nice to see so many familiar faces. That's kind of one of the great things about the tour is that no matter how long you've kind of been away, you just kind of pick up where you left off and everybody just kind of says 'Hey' like they saw you yesterday. \"It's nice getting out and seeing a tour setup again and preparing for that... Eventually it was always going to be my turn to come out.\" With golf courses shut down for months at home and a late return to US events, Fleetwood hopes to play his way back into form quickly. \"I'm going to work hard and play hard and see how well we can do,\" he said.

        "body": "GURUGRAM: Those working at offices in Gurugram will have their first encounter with the post-Covid workplace on Monday. The new normal will have mandatory health checks, spaced out seating plans and markings in front of the coffee machine to tell you how far apart you should be. \u201cWe will be opening our Gurugram office on Monday with 25% strength,\u201d said Captain Gaurav Bajetha, head of workplace and administration at Urban Company. \u201cTo ensure social distancing, we are rearranging our meeting room. We are changing the seating arrangement so that no employee faces another. There are markings in front of coffee machines and washrooms for employees to follow distancing,\u201d he added. The Gurugram-based startup has also developed an in-house app, UC Care, for its employees. They have to download it and check in with their health assessment every day. Only those who clear the health check will be given green passes to come to office. Online automobile marketplace Droom is planning a phased reopening. \u201cWe will open our Gurugram office on Monday. Resumption of operations will be gradual \u2014 beginning with about 10% of the employees next week, going up to one-third the following week and half the total strength the week after that,\u201d said Sandeep Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of Droom. The office has already been sanitised with germ-shield antimicrobial coating technology \u2014 a service Droom itself offers for cars. \u201cThe process eliminates 99.9% germs and is effective for a minimum of 90 days,\u201d Aggarwal said. Anyone entering the office premises has to go through a sanitisation tunnel and thermal scanning process. This is in addition to the mandatory use of masks and hand sanitisers. Like Urban Company, it will also have a fresh seating plan, optimised to maintain a six-feet distance between employees. \u201cIf someone has symptoms or is unwell, we urge them to work from home and not come to office,\u201d said Aggarwal. The organisations do foresee some operational constraints, but are trying to work their way around those. Food arrangements, for instance, might be a problem. \u201cMost companies, including us, are avoiding mass lunches in cafeterias to maintain social distancing and avoid access to any outside vendor or its staff,\u201d said Arrman Chaudhry, president, people and culture, M3M Group. The biggest challenge, however, is how employees will get to their workplaces. \u201cWe are operating with about 15% of our strength in offices, spread out across locations. But our employees are having a tough time commuting. Public transport is not open. With some relaxation in commuting rules in orange and green zones, it might get better,\u201d said Chaudhry. \u201cThen, there are also people who live in other cities. For them, coming in is not an option at all.\u201d In fact, the restrictions on cross-border movement are why many organisations have chosen not to open their offices yet. \u201cWe are not planning to open our offices for at least another week. Our organization considers safety of our employees as the priority. We have an extremely rigorous process of vetting the needs of employees to work from office. We are also getting our offices ready with appropriate safety precautions in case we decide to bring employees in at some point,\u201d said Harsh Vinayak, senior leader at NTT Data Service, a Japanese multinational company that has more than 2,500 employees working in its Gurugram offices.

        "title": "How oil majors shift billions in profits to island tax havens ",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: Bermuda and the Bahamas aren\u2019t exactly big players in the oil-and-gas world. They don\u2019t produce any of the fuels at all. Yet the islands are deep wells of profit for European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc. In 2018 and 2019, Shell earned more than $2.7 billion - about 7% of its total income in those years - tax-free by reporting profits in companies located in Bermuda and the Bahamas that employed just 39 people and generated the bulk of their revenue from other Shell entities, company filings show. If the oil-and-gas major had booked the profits through its headquarters in the Netherlands, it could have faced a tax bill of about $700 million based on the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. The bill would have been much steeper if the income were reported in oil-producing countries - some of which levy rates exceeding 80%. Shell and other oil majors are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes in countries where they drill by shifting profits to thinly staffed insurance and finance affiliates based in tax havens, according to a Reuters review of corporate filings and rating agency reports. Shell, BP Plc, Chevron and Total use subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Switzerland, Bermuda, the UK Channel Islands and Ireland to provide their global operations with banking, insurance and oil-trading services, the documents show. These subsidiaries, in turn, book profits that go lightly taxed or entirely tax-free. Such arrangements are not illegal. But they highlight the ability of international oil corporations to game global tax systems and avoid handing over revenue to nations where they conduct their core business, according to academics who study corporate taxation. The profits generated by those offshore units are enormous, despite their tiny operations. BP\u2019s so-called captive insurer - meaning it serves only other BP entities - had $6.5 billion in cash on hand at the end of 2018 after years of robust annual profits, according to insurance rating agency AM Best Co. The insurer, Jupiter Insurance Ltd, has accounted for as much as 14% of BP\u2019s global annual profits in recent years, according to AM Best figures and BP\u2019s financial statements. Jupiter has six directors but no employees; BP outsources insurance administration to a brokerage located in Guernsey, a tax haven in the UK Channel Islands. The big oil firms\u2019 captive insurers are far more profitable than a typical insurance company. That\u2019s because the amount they pay in claims accounts for a far lower proportion of the money collected in premiums - all from other affiliates of the oil giants - than is the case at other insurers, Industry data shows. That means the captive insurance units absorb part of the revenue made by the oil majors\u2019 subsidiaries elsewhere - often in high-tax countries where they extract oil and gas - and shift it to operations located in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions. The oil companies have also transferred capital to tax havens to establish banking units that lend money to sister companies. Shell established an oil trader in the Bahamas that generates revenue primarily by buying and selling oil among other Shell affiliates. The companies named in this story all said they followed tax rules of the nations where they do business. Their subsidiaries in tax havens, the companies said, were located there for commercial or operational reasons rather than to avoid taxation. Shell denied that its arrangements constituted tax avoidance and said the location of its subsidiaries were driven by business rather than tax reasons. BP declined to answer questions about its insurance subsidiary but a spokesman directed Reuters to a 2018 tax policy statement - published to meet a regulatory requirement - which said the company does not engage in profit-shifting. Profit-shifting has long been a concern among the Group of 20 nations, which have asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Oecd), which helps coordinate international taxation rule-making, to find ways to rein in corporate tax avoidance. The organization in February issued new guidance on the treatment of intra-group financial transactions, advising nations to limit deductions on such payments. Critics of corporate tax planning say oil firms\u2019 profit-shifting undermines their claims to responsible corporate governance and exacerbates the deep budgetary problems that many oil-producing countries face amid the coronavirus pandemic and a related drop in oil prices. \u201cThese companies are deliberately exploiting gaps in tax law and weak enforcement, and they are doing so in order to make enormous profits,\u201d said Raymond Baker, president of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington D C-based not-for-profit organization that has lobbied for stricter international action against corporate tax avoidance. \u201cThe victims are the countries and their budgets and their people.\u201d Nations such as Angola, Brazil and Trinidad, who rely heavily on oil tax revenues, have had to moderate spending and increase borrowing to respond to the health crisis. Nigeria is another country that relies heavily on oil tax revenues. Waziri Adio - executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which advocates for stronger governance of oil revenues - said the practices of oil companies may be legal but aren't fair. \u201cThis is something that robs Nigeria of legitimate revenues and will affect the ability of the government to deliver badly needed services to its citizens,\u201d Adio said. The governments of Nigeria, Angola, Brazil and Trinidad did not respond to requests for comment. Tax advisors said companies owe it to their shareholders to pay the lowest-possible tax bill. \u201cTax planning is a legitimate part of business,\u201d said Bryan Kelly, a partner with law firm Withers in Los Angeles. \u201cThe board of directors has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits.\u201d \u2018The numbers don't make sense\u2019Shell booked $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 profits through Bermuda-based banking and insurance subsidiaries that together employed three people, according to the company\u2019s \u2018Tax Contribution Reports\u2019 published in November this year and December 2019 which detail tax payments. The tiny firms provide insurance and loans to Shell oil-producing facilities worldwide, although Shell said in its most recent tax report, published last month, that it ceased the intra-group lending from Bermuda in 2020 for reasons the company did not disclose. In 2018, the companies derived 96% of their revenues from other Shell companies. The operations appear to exist primarily for tax purposes, said Richard Murphy, professor of political economy at City University of London. The high profitability of the Bermudan units \u2013 along with their heavy reliance on revenue from affiliates \u2013 suggests that they are designed to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions, he said. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t make sense. If Shell is so good at making money in insurance and lending, why doesn\u2019t it sell its services to outside companies and make even more money?\u201d Murphy said. Shell denied that its Bermuda operations are designed for tax avoidance. \u201cWhere Shell entities operate in low-tax jurisdictions, they are there for commercial and substantive reasons,\u201d the company said in a statement. Over $1.8 billion of Shell\u2019s 2018 and 2019 tax-haven profits were booked by Shell Western Supply and Trading Ltd, a Bahamas-based oil trading operation employing 36 people, Shell said in its tax reports. The company buys oil from Shell fields and other producers in West Africa, Brazil and Guyana and sells two-thirds of the crude to other Shell affiliates. The in-house oil trader outperforms other big oil merchants. Its annual profits were almost equal to the total $992 million that was earned through the end of September 2019 by independent oil trader Trafigura Group PTE Ltd - which employed 5,106 staff that year, Trafigura\u2019s financial statements show. Shell Western enjoyed a profit margin of 4.1% across 2018 and 2019, according to its tax report. That\u2019s more than four times the level independent oil traders typically report, according to financial statements of the three of the biggest industry players - The Vitol Group, Trafigura and Mercuria Energy Trading BV. Margaret Cooper, a researcher at Henley Business School near London who studies multinational firms\u2019 tax planning strategies, said that in-house oil trader\u2019s location, its relative high profits and its dependence on trading with affiliated firms suggests that its dealings are designed to avoid taxes. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other reason than tax reasons why the company is located where it is,\u201d Cooper said. Shell declined to comment on whether Shell Western pays any taxes or to answer questions about whether its oil-trading operation is designed for tax avoidance. The company said in a statement that Shell Western\u2019s profits are commensurate with its commercial activities. Big insurance profits, low taxes for BPBP\u2019s unusually profitable insurer is housed in the picturesque St Peters Port, the largest town on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. A 2019 report from insurance rating agency AM Best noted strong underwriting profits and operating results over the past five years, resulting in a \u201cvery strong\u201d balance sheet, with $6.5 billion in cash at the end of 2018. AM Best reports from previous years include more details on the operation - including immense profits that would be the envy of any insurer. In 2014, Jupiter had an operating ratio - which includes pay-outs and other costs as a share of premiums - of just 1.3%. That compares to more than 90% for most US insurers, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group. Jupiter booked profits totaling $5.8 billion from 2010 to 2013, the last year for which AM Best published profit figures. In 2013, Jupiter\u2019s earnings amounted to 14% of the operating profit reported by BP in financial disclosures. Jupiter\u2019s profit margins remained exceptional through those years despite the explosion of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. The incident caused $70 billion in damages, but Jupiter\u2019s payouts to affiliated companies were capped at $1.5 billion for any one event. So, the insurer kept a loss ratio under 15% of premium income for the years 2009 to 2013, according to a 2014 AM Best report. BP group retained access to Jupiter\u2019s hefty cash pile because the captive insurer lends 98% of its reserves back to Jupiter\u2019s parent, London-based BP International Ltd, for terms of a year or less, according to AM Best. BP pays interest on the money back to Jupiter, adding to the insurer\u2019s low-tax profits. Murphy, the University of London professor, estimates Jupiter could save BP hundreds of millions of dollars annually given its high profitability and the high tax rates that many countries place on oil production. Guernsey, some 75 miles south of the British coastline, is not part of the UK but is a British crown dependency, and sets its own tax rates. It charges no tax on corporate profits derived from revenues generated outside the island. BP declined to answer questions about Jupiter\u2019s operations and how much tax, if any, the insurer pays. Company spokesman David Nicholas referred Reuters to its December 2018 publication on tax policy, which states it does not \u201cengage in artificial tax arrangements.\u201d Jupiter\u2019s registered office is on the first floor of Albert House on the Esplanade, overlooking the harbor in St Peter Port. The offices are not BP\u2019s but belong to a multinational insurance brokerage and advisory company, Willis Towers. Richard Parris Smith, head of office at Willis Towers Management Guernsey, said his firm manages Jupiter on behalf of BP and has 30 employees that serve all of its clients. Willis Towers lists 35 other captive insurers as clients on a sign outside its office door. Chevron's Bermuda insurerCalifornia-based Chevron Corp operates a captive insurer in Bermuda. Until 2015, AM Best issued reports on Heddington Insurance Ltd and rated it highly due to its \u201cgood loss history\u201d and \u201cvery strong investment income\u201d made through high-interest loans to other Chevron companies. The rating agency did not report specific profit figures or operating ratios for Chevron\u2019s insurer. Chevron said it formed Heddington to reduce insurance costs and provide broader coverage than what is available in the commercial insurance market. The company said the insurer paid US taxes but declined to detail how much or the effective rate. Other oil firms have tax-haven subsidiaries through which they self-insure their facilities. France\u2019s Total SA operates Swiss-based Omnium Reinsurance Company SA, its financial filings show. Total did not respond to requests for comment about Omnium. Switzerland offers captive insurers special tax treatment and rates of less than 10%. Italy\u2019s Eni SpA operates an Irish-based insurer which covers the company\u2019s facilities in places including Algeria and Nigeria. Like Shell and BP\u2019s insurers, Dublin-based Eni Insurance DAC enjoys lower pay-out costs as a percentage of revenue than insurance industry averages. It reported a profit of 56 million euros in 2018, on which it paid tax at a rate of just 12.5% \u2013 half the Italian rate, and a fraction of the amount it would face in oil producing countries. Eni Insurance DAC says in its financial statements that it aims to reduce insurance costs for the Eni group. Eni said its insurer generates strong profits because it does not have marketing costs to recruit clients like most insurers. The company said in a statement that the insurer\u2019s premiums are in line with market rates and denied the business is designed for tax avoidance. \u201cThe decision to establish the Eni Captive headquarters in Ireland was solely driven by business reasons,\u201d the company said.

        "title": "NCLT gives nod to Reliance Infratel resolution plan; lenders may get around Rs 4,400 crore ",
        "body": "MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday approved a resolution plan of Reliance Infratel following which lenders may get around Rs 4,400 crore and Reliance Jio may pick up the assets of the debt-ridden telecom infrastructure company, according to sources. Reliance Jio through its subsidiary placed bids to acquire assets of Reliance Communications' fully owned subsidiary Reliance Infratel which has been approved by the tribunal as part of the resolution plan, a source aware of the development told PTI. \"The lenders will get around Rs 4,400 crore from Reliance Digital Platform, a group company of Reliance Jio and the successful resolution applicant,\" the source said. Under the approved resolution plan approved by lenders, RCom and its subsidiary Reliance Telecom Infrastructure Ltd (RTIL) will go to UV Asset Reconstruction Company (UVARCL), while the tower unit Reliance Infratel will go to Jio for a total consideration of Rs 20,000-23,000 crore to be paid over a period of seven years. Reliance Infratel, which has around 43,000 towers and 1,72,000 route kilometres fiber, is going through insolvency proceedings at the Mumbai bench of NCLT. Resolution Plan was approved by 100 per cent votes of the committee of creditors. \"Distribution of the proceeds from resolution plan is subject to the disposal of the Doha Bank Intervention Application,\" the source said. Email sent to the resolution professional of Reliance Infratel did not receive any immediate reply. RCom's overall debt is estimated to be around Rs 46,000 crore when the company had filed for bankruptcy with around 53 financial creditors submitting their claims that included domestic banks, foreign banks, non-banking financial companies and funds. Besides the banks, operational creditors like the tower companies, equipment vendors and the telecom department have claimed nearly Rs 30,000 crore in dues, of which over Rs 21,000 crore has been verified. RCom was forced to shut its wireless operations late 2017, hurt by mounting debt and and widening losses amid intense competition in the telecom sector after Jio's entry in September 2016. It tried to sell its wireless assets, such as spectrum and towers, to Jio, but failed due to a slew of legal cases. This forced the telco and its units to opt for insolvency proceedings, which was admitted under the IBC in May 2019.  ",

        "title": "US Congress passes bill to delist deceitful Chinese companies from American stock markets ",
        "body": "WASHINGTON: The US Congress has passed a bill that prohibits companies from being listed on American stock markets if they fail to provide the regulators access to their audit information for three years in a row, paving the way to delist deceitful Chinese companies from the US securities exchanges. The bipartisan Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act will help protect American investors and their retirement savings from foreign companies that have been operating on US stock exchanges while flouting oversight. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. It was passed by the Senate on May 20. The bill now heads to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign it into law. The bill prohibits securities of a company from being listed on any of the US securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row. It requires public companies to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government, including China's communist government; and ensures foreign companies traded in America are subject to the same independent audit requirements that apply to American companies. The Trump administration has passed a series of measures aimed at severing the economic ties between the US and China. US-China ties have deteriorated sharply over issues ranging from trade, the coronavirus pandemic and telecoms-gear maker Huawei to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong. \u201cThere is no reason to let Communist China game the system and put American investments in jeopardy. Our bill protects our constituents' hard-earned money and shines a light on China's nefarious actions. I am glad the House supported it and look forward to President (Donald) Trump signing it,\u201d Senator Kevin Cramer said. \u201cThis may be the most significant piece of investor protection legislation passed in several years,\u201d said Congressman Brad Sherman, Chair of the Investor Protection and Capital Markets subcommittee. It is designed to assure Financial Statement integrity of 224 US-limited companies with over $1.8 trillion in market capitalisation. The purpose is not to de-list any company, but to persuade China to allow the audit oversight that US investors need, and the US investors get when investing in US companies or companies in over 50 foreign jurisdictions, he said. Currently, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is unable to inspect the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms in a handful of foreign jurisdictions, primarily China. In most cases, audit firms in those foreign countries cite local laws related to data protection, privacy, confidentiality, or national security as the reason for being unable to provide the PCAOB with the information they need to complete their inspections. According to PCAOB, accounting firms which are unable to provide information necessary for effective oversight currently serve as the principal auditor for 224 US-listed companies which have a combined total of $1.8 trillion in market capitalisation. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act will protect investors and enforce a level playing field between US and foreign companies by requiring companies which go three years without the appropriate PCAOB audit inspection to be delisted from US exchanges. The legislation also requires foreign issuers to provide disclosures as to whether the company is owned or controlled by a foreign government. \u201cThe People's Republic of China has continuously sought to undermine and skirt rules to the detriment of American businesses and national security. In the case of their refusal to participate in PCAOB inspections, this situation is unfair and dangerous for investors,\u201d said Congressman Anthony Gonzalez. \u201cThe Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is designed to prevent companies based in China and certain other jurisdictions from taking advantage of our deep and liquid capital markets while avoiding the scrutiny that comes with inspection of their financial statement audits,\u201d he said. Senator John Kennedy said China is currently using US stock exchanges to exploit American workers and families - people who put their retirement and college savings in public companies. US policy is letting China flout rules that American companies play by, and it's dangerous, he said. \u201cMillions of American families rely on modest investments to retire, send their kids to college, and weather financial emergencies. But many have been cheated out of their money after investing in seemingly-legitimate Chinese companies that are not held to the same standards as other publicly listed companies,\u201d Senator Chris Van Hollen said. \u201cThis bill rights that wrong, ensuring that all companies on the US exchanges abide by the same rules. I've been proud to work with Senator Kennedy on this bipartisan legislation, and I'm glad to see it pass the House with such strong support. I urge the President to sign this bill into law immediately,\u201d he said.  ",

        "title": "Indian SaaS companies will have 7-9% of global market by 2022: Bain ",
        "body": "BENGALURU: India is on track to emerge as a SaaS (software as a service) powerhouse, fuelled by a massive shift from on-premise to the cloud, and growing investor appetite, says a new report by Bain & Company on the Indian SaaS business. Indian-heritage SaaS companies, it says, are poised to collectively reach $18-20 billion in revenue, and capture 7% to 9% share of the global SaaS market by 2022. Currently, their share is estimated at 3-4%. Early SaaS companies such as Zoho, Freshworks, Druva and Icertis have broken through the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark, with several other firms seen to be well placed to follow suit over the next 12 to 18 months. Aditya Shukla, partner in Bain & Company\u2019s Mumbai office who co-authored the report, says several different types of Indian SaaS companies have emerged. \u201cThere are SMB-focused SaaS companies, such as Zoho and Freshworks, targeting global markets with horizontal offerings. We also have vertical-specific SaaS companies, such as Locus and Innovaccer, disrupting underserved verticals like healthcare and logistics. There are globally competitive companies in emerging tech, such as Postman in application programming interface (API) management and Hasura that helps in building modern apps and APIs faster. And there are those with products tailored for the domestic market, such as Darwinbox, MyGate and Yellow Messenger,\u201d he said. Shukla said many firms early on found it challenging to monetise in India owing to price-sensitive customers, so they have scaled outside of India. But today, even the domestic market is turning lucrative. Over 50 companies have breached the $10 million ARR milestone, and many more are expected to follow. The number of Indian SaaS firms is estimated at 7,000-8,000. Arpan Sheth, senior partner in Bain & Company\u2019s Mumbai office who leads the firm\u2019s Asia-Pacific technology, vector and advanced analytics practices, said $10 million ARR is a tipping point. \u201cThese players have a customer acquisition engine, which effectively allows them to acquire new customers. Expanding accounts from freemium to paid models, cross-selling into those accounts and geographic expansion are other business levers. Pricing is the most powerful lever,\u201d he says. SaaS investments constituted 15% of VC/growth equity investments in the first half of 2019 and this rose to 20% in the corresponding period in 2020. The report said Indian SaaS companies have distinct competitive advantages over their global peers, further accentuated by a level playing field. They need to pay about 85% and 74% lower salary for entry level developers and sales resources respectively, compared to the US. Depth and abundance of engineering talent is another advantage. Shukla says certain themes have become salient and have major implications for the ecosystem. Infrastructure management tools and platforms (for instance, Hasura, LambdaTest), he says, will continue to proliferate. The DevOps community provides an attractive opportunity given its high degree of standardisation, strong network effects and large local developer base to build and test tools. Tools fuelling the API economy (for instance, Postman, Setu, YAP) will continue to grow and expand as APIs become central to modern application development. Remote working will drive collaboration tools. Intelligent automation of business processes will grow.  ",

Excerpts. How do you assess Grand Alliance\u2019s prospects?There is a yearning for change in Bihar. Fifteen years of misrule, misgovernance, rampant corruption, absolute bankruptcy of ideas and vision has dissipated an immensely talented human resource-rich state like Bihar. The Mahagatbandhan is solidly united, has crisp and clear ideas and has brought in new freshness to Bihar. What is your opinion on Tejashwi Yadav as GA\u2019s CM candidate? He is young, will he be able to lead the GA flock as CM of Bihar?I always feel this country has to have faith in its young, not only in politics but in every sphere. Tejashwi has good intentions. He comes with a clean slate. He has new ideas. He has the energy that is representative of the new Bihar. He will get the wisdom, support and experience of Congress party. So Tejashwi\u2019s energy and Congress\u2019s experience, as well as the experience of the Left parties will be a unique combination to run Bihar, unlike the corrupt, tired leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi. You have Nitish who is tested, failed and tired and waiting to be retired and you have Tejashwi Yadav who brings in new energy, ideas and freshness. Congress managed to get a large number of seats. People say you got quantity, not quality. Are you happy with the kind of seats you\u2019ve got?In any alliance, there will be some sacrifices. RJD, CPI, CPM, CPI (ML) and Congress, all have made sacrifices. We fought on 41 seats last time, now we are fighting on 70. We are fighting where we have not done well. But the very fact that Congress\u2019 flags are flying there, our workers are energized. We will convert the so-called weak seats into winning seats. In Bihar caste-based vote bank is always talked about. Be it HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manhi, RLSP head Upendra Kushwaha or VIP founder Mukesh Sahni, they all have left Mahagatbandhan. Will Mahagatbandhan be able to get the vote of people belonging to their castes?See, caste is a reality. But caste and religion, both can be subjugated to the idea of development. We believe that the agenda which GA has set, cuts across caste and religion, classical formulae that have been sold in Bihar. For the first time, we are experimenting with vision, development and progress over caste and religion. We feel we will succeed not only in those sections which these three represent but also in sections which Nitish Babu and BJP have always thought to be their citadels. What about the Owaisi factor? Muslims are said to be RJD and Congress vote bank. Will this factor affect your votes?Owaisi is a BJP agent and only serves BJP\u2019s agenda everywhere in the country. They are two sides of the same coin. Having said that, neither Congress nor RJD looks at the Muslim community as a vote bank. We believe that the Muslim community has a role to play in the development of Bihar and the country. Nitish babu speaks about secularism from the platform of RSS. Do you miss Lalu\u2019s presence?Lalu Yadav Ji is a maverick politician. He loves people and people love him back. He creates emotion which many politicians in this country cannot generate. Yes, if he was around, it would have been a great help. But let me tell you, Tejashwi has brought in a new whip of freshness. Will Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi come to Bihar for campaigning?Rahul Ji is coming on October 23 and Tejashwi Yadav will address a rally with him. GA, as well as Congress, have made big promises ahead of polls. Will these be fulfilled in five years?Bihar has a broad budget of Rs 1.27 lakh crore. May I ask Nitish Babu, where do you spend this money? If you give a scooty to every girl who secures 90% marks, it cannot cost more than Rs 50 crore. If you waive registration charges for farmers, it will cost around Rs 5 to 6 crore. Biharis run the IT hub of Bangalore, Gurguram, Chennai, why cannot Patna be an IT hub? That human resource, if unleashed, can create jobs right here in Bihar. Tap the tourism sector and lakhs will get a job. What edge does Mahagabtandhan has over NDA and vice-versa?NDA is a combination of aged leaders, tired and retired. Mahagatbandhan is a combination of energy, freshness, ideas and experience.  ",

        "title": "Sales of manufacturing companies contracted 41.1% in Q1, says RBI report ",
        "body": "MUMBAI: Aggregate sales of private sector manufacturing companies recorded a sharp contraction of 41.1 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020-21, reflecting the impact of the pandemic induced lockdown, said a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) analysis on Tuesday. The data on the performance of the private corporate sector during the first quarter of 2020-21 has been drawn from abridged quarterly financial results of 2,5361 listed non-government non-financial (NGNF) companies, the RBI said. \"Aggregate sales of 1,619 manufacturing companies recorded a sharp contraction of 41.1 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2020-21 following 15.6 per cent decline in Q4:2019-20 reflecting the impact of the pandemic induced lockdown,\" it said. The contraction was broad-based and varied across industries - only pharmaceutical companies recorded higher sales on both annual and sequential (q-o-q) basis. Non-IT services companies also registered a sharp contraction of 41 per cent in their nominal sales. The contraction was across services except for telecommunication companies, the RBI said. On the other hand, the sales growth of IT sector companies remained in positive terrain but moderated to 3.2 per cent in the April-June quarter of the fiscal on annual basis. It further said lower business operations led to decline in the operating profits of manufacturing and non-IT services companies, while operating profits of IT companies, on the other hand, increased 9.4 per cent during the first quarter. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had extended the deadline for submission of financial results for Q1:2020-21 by listed companies to September 15, 2020. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank has also released the results of the 2019-20 round of the Survey of Foreign Liabilities and Assets of the Mutual Fund (MF) Companies. Foreign liabilities of MF companies declined by 15.7 per cent during 2019-20 and stood at $9.6 billion in March 2020, mainly consisting of units issued to non-residents. Their overseas assets were much lower at $0.8 billion. \"The UAE, the UK and the USA accounted for 38 per cent of the total MF units held by non-residents,\" it said and added overseas equity investments of MF companies were largely concentrated in Luxembourg and the USA. In the case of Asset Management Companies (AMCs), the foreign liabilities stood at $4.4 billion in March 2020 as compared to their foreign assets of $0.1 billion. Non-residents in the UK and Japan together held nearly 89 per cent FDI in the AMCs.  ",

The MOU was signed in the presence of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. While explaining about the MoU, Dushyant Chautala said that under the MoU, in the first phase, 50,000 meritorious candidates will be given coaching for Group-C and Group-D jobs through online programmes, which will include 70% youth from rural areas and 30% from urban areas. He said that through this new platform, online coaching will be given to those youth who have given various competitive examinations conducted under Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) and have missed being selected by a very thin margin. He said that the progress of their preparation will be reviewed every week and every month, out of which there is a plan to prepare the top 1,000 youth for Group-A and Group-B jobs by giving live coaching. Dushyant further stated that 'Grade Stack Learning Private Limited (GradeUp)' platform has been selected to provide online coaching which will provide a web-link to the employment Department to register the candidates. He said that for the first batch, 50,000 candidates will be provided video lectures, quizzes, mock tests, previous question papers and other course material for 18 months. A candidate can select 3 courses or examinations such as Banking & Insurance, SSC & Railways, CDS & Defense etc. to access the material. A dashboard will be made available to the Employment Department to show the performance of the candidates in the Gradeup Monthly Mock Examination. Mock tests of the candidates will be conducted through the study of dashboard and weekly data, in which the candidates who perform well will be transferred from the low performing batches.  Deputy CM said that at present Haryana's participation in Central Government jobs is only 2%, which is targeted to be taken up to 7-8%. He said that through this MoU, the youth of the state will get such coaching so that they can get selected by performing better for government and private jobs of neighboring states including Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan.

The incentives will be at par with those offered to the manufacturing industry,\u201d said sources close to the development. \u201cLike manufacturing firms, fintech companies will get EPF, electricity duty exemption and stamp duty exemption among other benefits. Moreover, the government plans to give incentives like extra FSI for the new buildings coming up for the fintech industry.

Industry players sounded upbeat saying a dedicated fintech policy is a must for Gujarat. \"The fintech policy along with a services sector policy will provide a much needed thrust to BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector in the state. It will help attract global in-house centers (GIC) and business processing outsourcing (BPO) units to GIFT City and Gujarat,\u201d said Jaimin Shah, Board Member, Nasscom. \u201cThere must be a policy and incentives to attract and promote financial sector players, including financial sector business process outsourcing (BPO) units, to GIFT City,\u201d added Shah, who is also the managing director of the Ahmedabad-based Dev IT Ltd. The objective of GIFT City is to develop an information technology driven financial services ecosystem. The purpose of GIFT City cannot be fully achieved if there is no fintech policy for the state, said industry players. The government aims to initiate discussions with stakeholders after Diwali.

        "title": "Large NBFCs can become banks: RBI ",
        "body": "MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that there is a case for systemically important non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) beyond a certain size to convert into banks and subject them to the same prudent regulatory framework. This arrangement will enable a regulation-light structure to continue for most NBFCs that gives them the flexibility to serve the last-mile consumers. \u201cThe spill-over of risks from a systematically important NBFC capable of transmitting perceptible impact on financial stability must be dealt with in a proportionate manner. So, NBFCs with significant externalities and which contribute substantially to systemic risks must be identified and subjected to a higher degree of regulation,\u201d said RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao, speaking at a summit on NBFCs organised by Assocham. According to the RBI, risks from NBFCs can be passed on to the banking system. As of end-March 2020, NBFCs have been the largest net borrowers of funds from the financial system, of which more than half were from scheduled commercial banks, followed by mutual funds and insurance companies. Pointing out that very large finance companies need the same regulation as banks, Rao said, \u201cOne can also argue that the design of a prudential regulatory framework for such NBFCs can be comparable with banks so that beyond a point of criticality to systemic risks, such NBFCs should have incentives either to convert into a commercial bank or scale down their network externalities within the financial system.\u201d The RBI has increased its vigilance over the NBFC segment following high growth in the last decade, which was followed by a collapse of two large finance companies IL&FS and DHFL. Between March 31, 2009, and March 31, 2019, the total assets of NBFCs grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.6% \u2014 almost twice as fast as banks, which grew with a CAGR of 10.7%. With this growth, the balance sheet size of the NBFC sector increased from 9.3% to 18.6% of the aggregate balance sheet size of commercial banks. In absolute terms, the asset size of the NBFC sector (including housing finance companies), as on March 31, 2020, is Rs 51 lakh crore.  ",
