        "title": "Apple launches its most advanced headphones, AirPods Max, at Rs 59,900 ",
        "body": "Apple has finally introduced its much awaited over-ear headphones and it\u2019s called AirPods Max. This premium headphone costs Rs 59,900 in India, making it more expensive than the iPhone 11. In the US, it cost $549 which translates to around Rs 40,500. The AirPods Max are available to order starting today on Apple website and Apple Authorised Resellers. Shipping will start from December 15. Apple says that the AirPods Max features a custom acoustic design, H1 chips, and advanced software to power computational audio. To improve the listening experience, there are modes like Adaptive EQ, Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and spatial audio. AirPods Max come in five colours-- space gray, silver, sky blue, green, and pink. Apple claims the battery life to be up to 20 hours with Active Noise Cancellation and spatial audio enabled. AirPods Max comes with a soft Smart Case that puts AirPods Max in an ultralow power state that helps to preserve battery charge when not in use. The AirPods Max has a stainless steel headband frame with breathable knit mesh canopy. There\u2019s a Digital Crown, inspired by Apple Watch, which offers precise volume control and the ability to play or pause audio, skip tracks, answer or end phone calls, and activate Siri. AirPods Max offers a 40-mm Apple-designed dynamic driver and is equipped with an Apple-designed H1 chip in each ear cup. Apple claims a unique dual neodymium ring magnet motor allows AirPods Max to maintain total harmonic distortion of less than 1% across the entire audible range, even at maximum volume. AirPods Max use Adaptive EQ to adjust the sound to the fit and seal of the ear cushions by measuring the sound signal delivered to a user and adjusting the low and mid-frequencies in real time. (Apple AirPods Max soft Smart Case) To enable Active Noise Cancellation, each ear cup features three outward-facing microphones to detect environmental noise, while one microphone inside the ear cup monitors the sound reaching the listener\u2019s ear. \u201cUsing computational audio, noise cancellation continuously adapts to the headphone fit and movement in real time,\u201d claims Apple. With AirPods Max, users can switch to Transparency mode to simultaneously listen to music while hearing the environment around them \u2014 ensuring everything, including a user\u2019s own voice, sounds natural while audio plays perfectly. Switching between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode can be done with a single press using the noise control button. AirPods Max use spatial audio with dynamic head tracking to place sounds virtually in an accurate manner making it ideal for content recorded in 5.1, 7.1, and Dolby Atmos. Using the gyroscope and accelerometer in AirPods Max and iPhone or iPad, spatial audio tracks the motion of a user\u2019s head as well as the device, compares the motion data, then remaps the sound field so it stays anchored to the device, even as the user\u2019s head moves. There\u2019s automatic switching that allows users to seamlessly move sound between iPhone, iPad, and Mac. When playing music on Mac, users can easily take a call on iPhone and AirPods Max will automatically switch over. Audio Sharing makes it possible to easily share an audio stream between two sets of AirPods on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV 4K. Simply bring AirPods Max near the device and connect with a single tap.3 With Siri capabilities you get the ability to play music, make phone calls, control the volume, get directions, and more. Siri can also read incoming messages as they arrive with Announce Messages with Siri.  ",

        "title": "Apple sold almost half of global smartwatches in Q3 2020, claims report ",
        "body": "Apple seems to be on a roll when it comes to the Apple Watch. First a report by IDC suggested that Apple has sold a record high number of units in the third quarter of 2020 and now a report by research agency Counterpoint has said that the Cupertino-based tech giant has gained a stronger position by accounting for \u201cnearly half of global smartwatch shipments\u201d in the third quarter of 2020. Analyst Sujeong Lim said, \u201cIn terms of sales, Apple\u2019s position is even stronger. In the third quarter, it achieved $2.3 billion, nearly half of global smartwatch shipments and an 18% increase over the same period last year.\u201d The company stood at the first spot in the global smartwatch market. It also saw an increase of 2% in the market share as compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u201cIt launched its first mid-tier smartwatch, the Apple Watch SE, during the quarter. Priced at less than $300, it received a lot of attention from the market,\u201d said Counterpoint in its report. Overall, the worldwide smartwatch shipments increased 6% in Q3 2020 compared to the same period last year. The top five brands -- Apple, Huawei, Samsung, BBK and Fitbit -- contributed more than 66% of the total shipments in Q3 2020, as per the report. Speaking specifically about India, the report said, \u201cIndia, which occupies only about 4% share, has emerged as a bigger market than the MEA (Middle East and Africa) and Latam (Latin America), with shipments growing 95% YoY. Lim added, \u201cIn India, local brand Noise is growing rapidly while Realme, a Chinese brand familiar to Indian consumers, launched the Watch in the third quarter. The country\u2019s smartwatch market seems to have reached its first period of growth, thanks to the active expansion of brands. The market is expected to grow in earnest from the end of next year after recovering from COVID-19.\u201d  ",

        "body": "Apple may have another surprise in 2020. The company will reportedly launch its much talked about over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio very soon. Multiple media reports are claiming that Apple may launch the AirPods Studio by this weekend itself. For a while now rumours have been rife about Apple launching over-the-ear headphones. In May 2020, a report by Digitimes suggested that Apple AirPods Studio have gone into production. The report citing sources had said back then, \u201cAs Apple is likely to accelerate dropping its wired earphones, the vendor will resume normal shipments for AirPods 2 in the second half of the year and its new over-ear headphones, dubbed \u200cAirPods Studio\u200c, has also kicked off production, all securing growth momentum for rigid-flex boards suppliers for the devices, including Unitech Printed Circuit Board and Compeq Manufacturing.\u201d It now seems that it is quite possible for Apple to actually release the AirPods Studio ahead of Christmas. The headphones from Apple have been in the works for quite sometime now. There has been information about them in the iOS 14 beta code as well. Reports claim that the headphone will be high-end and may cost similar to Sony WH-1000XM4 or the latest Bose QC 35 headphones. The price in the US is expected to be around $349 but in India it may cost above Rs 30,000.  ",

The new AirPods Max come in five colour options: Space Gray, Sky Blue, Silver, Pink and Green. With AirPods Max, Apple enters the space occupied by the likes of Sony, Bose, Jabra and Senneiser. How well the new Apple hardware compares to the top-end devices from these companies remains to be seen, but going by the company\u2019s track record is likely to be a worthy rival. So, for all those who plan to buy AirPods Max here are some small, but, not-to-miss details. What you get inside the box* AirPods Max headphones * Smart Case * Lightning to USB-C cable What add-ons you can buy and for how much* 20W USB-C Power Adapter: Rs 1,900 * Lightning to 3.5mm Audio Cable (1.2m): Rs 3,500 * AppleCare+ for AirPods Max: Rs 6,900, offers up to two years of tech support and accidental damage protection Compatibility with Apple devicesWorks with iPhone 8 or later and iPod touch (7th generation) with the latest version of iOS; 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation or later), 11-inch iPad Pro, 10.5-inch iPad Pro, iPad (5th generation or later), iPad Air (3rd and 4th generation) and iPad mini (5th generation) with the latest version of iPadOS; and Apple TV with the latest version of tvOS. Using Apple AirPods Max with non-Apple devicesYou can surely pair the new Apple headphones with your Android device, but you may not get the full features of the device. This is what Apple says: AirPods Max can be used as Bluetooth headphones with Apple devices using earlier software and with non-Apple devices, but functionality is limited. \"The key features that users will miss out on include instant pairing, automatic device switching, spatial audio, and more,\" says a report in 9to5mac. Replacement ear cushionsFor those who want to customise their AirPods Max, Apple is offering replacement cushions for Rs 6,500. The others can buy them as a backup pair or may be later as replacement for worn out cushions.  ",

        "body": "Apple has introduced its MagSafe Duo wireless charger for charging your iPhone and Apple Watch together at the same time. But the problem is that desolate spending Rs 13,900 on the device, Apple doesn\u2019t provide a charging adapter. To get the desired charging performance you either have to separately buy the 20W USB-C Power Adapter for faster wireless charging up to 11W \u2013 27W or you can also opt for a new 30W power adapter for fast charging. But if you think that using the older 29W USB-C power adapter will get the job done then you are mistaken. The old 29WUSB-C power adapter that was launched in 2018 is not compatible with the Apple MagSafe Duo wireless charger. As per a report by MacRumors, you can either charge your iPhone or Apple Watch and not both the devices together. Apple in its support page has also confirmed the same and said, \u201cThe Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter isn't compatible with the MagSafe Duo Charger.\u201d While the new MagSafe chargers may sound attractive, it may not be a good choice for fast charging, depending on the money you want to spend. For example, if you are buying the new iPhone 12 Mini then you may want to skip Apple\u2019s new MagSafe wireless charger which offers wireless charging speeds of up to 15W. This is because the charging speed on the iPhone 12 mini is limited to just 12W. So, even if you buy Apple\u2019s 20W power adapter to use the MagSafe charger at full capacity of 15W, you will only get up to 12W wireless charging speeds on the iPhone 12 mini. Meanwhile, if you buy the iPhone 12 and above models, you will have to spend Rs 11,300 for the entire MagSafe experience-- Rs 4,500 for the MagSafe charger + Rs 4,900 for a MagSafe compatible case from Apple + Rs 1,900 for the 20W USB-C power adapter.

        "body": "Facebook and its family of apps are clearly unhappy with Apple. Every few weeks, there\u2019s some criticism on Apple by either Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. Yesterday, WhatsApp called out Apple\u2019s new app privacy label and how it was unfair. According to a report by Axios, WhatsApp said that the app privacy label was anti-competitive as Apple\u2019s own messaging service iMessage didn\u2019t need it as it came pre-loaded on iPhones. \u201cWe think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps,\u201d a WhatsApp spokesperson told Axios. \u201cWhile providing people with easy to read information is a good start, we believe it\u2019s important people can compare these \u2018privacy nutrition\u2019 labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.\u201d Apple has now responded to this criticism and made it clear that privacy labels will be applicable for its own apps as well. Apple told Axios, \u201cThe new rules apply equally to all iOS apps, including all Apple\u2018s built-in apps like Messages. For iOS apps that don\u2019t have dedicated product pages on the App Store, like Messages, they will still have the same privacy information be made available to users on Apple\u2019s website.\u201d Apple\u2019s new anti-tracking rules for apps has become quite a bone of contention between Facebook and the Cupertino-based tech giant. Apple is set to introduce App Tracking Transparency rules with a future version of iOS 14 and it hasn\u2019t gone down well with Facebook. Apple was supposed to introduce the feature earlier this year but has delayed it. Earlier this week, Craig Federighi, senior vice president, software engineering, Apple said that apps will be removed if they don\u2019t follow Apple\u2019s guidelines. In an interview with The Telegraph, Federighi said, \u201c\u2018There will be policy enforcement. Any form or mechanism of tracking a user for advertising or for providing information to data brokers will have to ask for permissions. Failure to do so is a violation of App Store policy\u2026 and are grounds for having an app removed.\"  ",

In such a scenario, remote working or work-from-home is the default option for many companies. Cupertino-based tech giant Apple, as per a report by Bloomberg, has no plans of calling majority of employees back to offices till June 2021. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees in a virtual town meeting about extending remote working. Cook stressed that while face-to-face collaboration cannot be replaced, work can be done remotely without affecting results. \u201cThere\u2019s no replacement for face-to-face collaboration, but we have also learned a great deal about how we can get our work done outside of the office without sacrificing productivity or results,\u201d he told staff, as per Bloomberg Cook further said that the learnings from this have been vital. \u201cAll of these learnings are important. When we\u2019re on the other side of this pandemic, we will preserve everything that is great about Apple while incorporating the best of our transformations this year,\u201d he reportedly told Apple employees. According to Bloomberg, Cook told employees that it \u201cseems likely\u201d that majority of the teams will not be back in offices before June 2021. The Apple Park campus in Cupertino is currently operating with just 15% of employees in the offices. Interestingly, Google recently revealed that some of its teams have been back in campuses. Google said that it had been holding meetings outdoors with employees and some new hires have also been coming to campuses. However, majority of Google\u2019s staff too has been working remotely. Most tech companies, for that matter, have had employees working from home with no set date on when they will resume work from offices.  ",

Also, Apple may include both Touch ID and Face ID in the next iPhone or iPhone 12. Apple is conducting a survey for iPhone 12 users and asking them several questions about the overall experience and the changes they may want. Talking about accessories, Apple may remove the USB-C-to-Lightning cable for charging and data transfer from the box of future iPhones. It may also remove the tiny SIM ejection tool and Apple stickers. As far the survey is concerned, reported by 9to5Mac, Apple is seriously considering to get genuine feedback about Face ID. As per the report, one of the questions were, if the user is dissatisfied with Face ID for reasons such as: Security or privacy concerns; I don\u2019t like having to pick up my phone to use Face ID; Slow performance; It does not detect my face in all situations (such as low light, different angles, lying down, wearing sunglasses); I prefer Touch ID; Not reliable; does not always unlock the iPhone; Other; Not sure.

        "body": "Scammers have figured out a new way to make iPhone and other Apple device owners into revealing their iCloud login credentials, warned The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in a new blog post. You may get a call from someone claiming that some \u201csuspicious activities\u201d may have put your Apple iCloud account at risk and you are required to talk to an Apple customer support executive to verify your personal details and \u201clock\u201d your ID. The scammers may sound quite intimidating. After the so-called executive alerts you about the possible \u201csuspicious activities\u201d on your iCloud account, he or she will ask you to press 1 or call a different phone number to fix the issue. It is highly recommended that users do not press 1 or dial any other number. \"In another twist on the scam, you get a recorded message that says there\u2019s been suspicious activity in your Apple iCloud account. In fact, they say your account may have been breached,\" said FTC in its blog post. The scam is very simple. Scare people, make them re-verify their accounts and in the process steal personal information including banking details and iCloud login credentials. These types of calls mostly ask you for your credit or debit card details and under no circumstances should you reveal these details to anyone over a call. A genuine customer support representative will never ask for any personal information or banking details ever. Scammers are also resorting to phishing scams to steal iCloud login details from owners of lost iPhonesMost iPhone owners use the Find My service to protect their iPhone in case it is lost or misplaced. So, when someone loses their iPhone, it is quite natural to lock it by marking the device as lost by visiting iCloud.com website. When an iPhone is marked as lost, it is remotely locked with a passcode and you can display a custom message with your phone number on your missing device's Lock screen. As the custom message on the lost iPhone displays a phone number, scammers are now sending an SMS to that phone number with a link to a phishing website which looks exactly like the iCloud website. The message reads, \u201cHello, your lost reported iPhone has been found. Click here to view the location\u201d along with the link to the phishing website. The moment you click on this link to see the location of your lost iPhone, a fake iCloud website which looks exactly similar to the original one, will open and ask you to login with your iCloud ID and password. This phishing website simply steals your login information and sends it to the scammers so that they are able to unlock your lost iPhone and use it.  ",

According to a report by Digitimes, the Taiwanese PCB makers have said that the AirPods Max \u201care meant for a relatively small niche market segment.\u201d The report says, \u201cPCB suppliers in Taiwan are not expecting a significant boost to their sales from AirPods Max, reasoning that over-ear headphones are positioned as a niche segment with higher prices but smaller market scale compared to earbuds.\u201d The report states that when it comes to over-ear headphones, JBL, Sony and Bose are \"firmly in the leader group\" in terms of market share. For those unaware, Apple\u2019s AirPods Max headphones have been launched in India at Rs 59,900. The new AirPods Max come in five colour options: Space Gray, Sky Blue, Silver, Pink and Green. AirPods Max offer a 40-mm Apple-designed dynamic driver and come powered by Apple-designed H1 chip in each ear cup.

        "body": "The iPad has never had a more robust portfolio in Apple\u2019s ranks. The Cupertino-based tech giant has an iPad starting from Rs 30,000 to over Rs 1 lakh. The cheapest iPad is the 8th-gen 10.2-inch iPad and if rumours are to be believed then Apple may bump up its specs. According to a report by Chinese website CNBeta, Apple is working on a revamped entry-level iPad. This rumoured iPad may feature a 10.5-inch display and have TouchID Home button. The next-gen entry-level iPad could also be powered by the A13 Bionic chip, which runs on the iPhone 11 series. Notably, the 10.5-inch screen is currently found in the all-new iPad Air. Apple, as per the report, could also bump the storage on the entry-level iPad from 32GB to 64GB. Other specifications are not expected to change. Apple had a busy 2020 as far as iPads are concerned. It first launched the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard in the first half of the year. In September, Apple introduced the new entry-level iPad and the iPad Air. The iPad Air has been the talk of tech town as it features the A14 bionic chip found in the iPhone 12 series. In India, the iPad Air starts at Rs 54,900 whereas the entry-level iPad starts at Rs 29,990. The iPad Pro, on the other hand, comes with a starting price of Rs 85,900. Both the iPad Air and iPad Pro support Apple\u2019s Magic keyboard but one has to shell out another Rs 27,900 for it. It will be interesting to see what 2021 has in store for the iPad and while Apple doesn\u2019t comment on speculation, we can expect the entry-level iPad to get refreshed as it is something Apple has done for a couple of years in a row.

        "body": "Most people that use a smartphone, tablet or laptop may not like to admit but too much of time is spent in front of screens. Smartphones have become the gateway for almost everything \u2014 reading news, consuming content \u2014 and it might become a problem soon. Apple CEO Tim Cook was recently asked in a podcast with The Outsider magazine about the rise of phone usage among the people. Cook said that he had a simple rule to check if people are using their phones too much. \u201cMy simple rule is, if you\u2019re looking at your device more than you\u2019re looking in somebody\u2019s eyes, you\u2019re doing the wrong thing \u2014 just very simple,\u201d said the Apple CEO. Well, there\u2019s no way to \u2018check\u2019 how many times you look in somebody\u2019s eyes but Apple does have a feature that tells you how many times you check your phone and more. A couple of years ago \u2014 with iOS 12 \u2014 Apple launched the Screen Time feature that gives a user a fair idea on how and how much they\u2019re using their devices. With Screen Time, users can see their iPhone, Mac or iPad usage. The data is further broken down to the amount of time a user has spent on individual apps. It also tells you the number of notifications that one has got and the frequency with which you check your iPhone. Google has a similar feature called Digital Wellbeing for Android phones as well. Cook further said Apple is looking to innovate in this space as well to check phone usage among people. \u201cWell, we take the challenge to continue innovating in that space just like we take the challenge to keep innovating in each of the product categories that we\u2019re in.\u201d  ",

Meanwhile, some users of the new iPhone 12 series are complaining that they are facing network connectivity issues and are unable to get 4G network reception. Users also reported having problems connecting to 5G networks in some countries. Affected users have taken to the official Apple forum to highlight their plight. One of the users also mentioned that he is forced to use the hotspot internet connectivity from his Samsung phone to run his new iPhone 12. Note that all users are not facing connectivity issues and it appears that only some users with certain telecom operators are affected by the issue.  ",

        "body": "Tech giant Apple has filed a new patent showcasing a hinge design for a smartphone, as per a report by AppleInsider. The patent is related to a display technology that can fold out and expand along the hinge. From the looks of it, the design could be employed to build a foldable iPhoneThe patent application is titled \"Electronic devices having folding expandable displays\". The figure shown in the patent details a foldable device with the display folded at an angle of 90-degrees. There are multiple links as part of the hinge, which means that there are going to be a number of articulation joints if Apple proceeds with the design in the future. As per the patent description: \u201c In some configurations, hinge structures for the device include gear teeth, belts, and/or other movement synchronization structures. The moving members in the hinge structures may include bars and links with opposing curved bearing surfaces. Stop surfaces may prevent excessive rotation of the bars and links with respect to each other. The bars and links or other moving members in the hinge structures may rotate relative to each other about virtual pivot points that lie outside of the hinge structures.\u201d While there have been foldable phones by Samsung, Huawei and Motorola, Apple hasn\u2019t yet launched one. The reception for the Galaxy Fold, Samsung\u2019s first foldable phone, was a mixed one initially, with reports of the displays malfunctioning arising. Samsung soon came up with moves to address the display issues with its next foldable device. The Cupertino-based tech giant is probably looking at more than testing the waters when it comes to foldable iPhones and may end up with a device that is a success in one go, should it decide upon developing it commercially.

In fact, Apple was reportedly working on the development of AirPods Max for the past four years. As per a report by AppleInsider, an ex-engineer at Apple named Dinesh Dave revealed the details on Twitter. Dave worked for Apple between June 2014 and February 2018. Interestingly, the report states that the development of the headphones started along with the original AirPods. Apple had launched the first AirPods Bluetooth earbuds in December 2016.

AirPods Max offers a 40-mm Apple-designed dynamic driver and is equipped with an Apple-designed H1 chip in each ear cup. Apple says that the AirPods Max features a custom acoustic design, H1 chips, and advanced software to power computational audio. To improve the listening experience, there are modes like Adaptive EQ, Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and spatial audio.

        "title": "Why Apple thinks it can sell you a Rs 60,000 headphone ",
        "body": "Some would say that the AirPods Max are \u2018peak\u2019 Apple as far as products are concerned. An eye-catching design, solid hardware and a price that creates quite a stir \u2014 so much so that it becomes the talking point. Rs 59,900 is a lot of money for a pair of headphones \u2014 even by Apple\u2019s standards but the folks at Cupertino are pretty sure of people making a beeline for buying them. Why you may wonder? Apple\u2019s design game looks on point. Yet againWell, let\u2019s begin with the design, something that Apple does far better than anyone else. Bose, Sony are the two names that make stellar headphones but Apple seems to have an edge in just the way the headphones look. Brands often like to have the same kind of look running all over their headphones. Apple has turned that idea on its head by putting in a mesh \u2014 who would\u2019ve thought a mesh on headphones \u2014 that flows along with the stainless steel headband. In Apple speak, the headband has a \u201crevolutionary mechanism\u201d that makes it easy to adjust and connect to the earcups with a hinge. Not sure how it works but sounds comfortable, no? One button to rule\u2019 em allOthers call it buttons, Apple calls it Digital Crown. It\u2019s a button \u2014 found in Apple Watch as well -- to control volume, change tracks among other things. AirPods are betting on Apple \u2018experience\u2019Apple isn\u2019t about the hardware always as it\u2019s about the experience. Like how the AirPods Max will connect seamlessly with an iPhone or iPad in a jiffy \u2014 something like no other headphone will do. The best of Apple hardware and software rolled in oneApple relies on computational audio to deliver superior sound output. The H1 chip inside the AirPods Max is capable of 9 billion operations a second. This is what will drive transparency, Active Noise Cancellation and adaptive EQ. Adaptive EQ will change the audio quality depending on the fit and seal of headphones \u2014 something that sounds really cool. Price is what we may call Apple being Apple2020 has been a bit of anomaly for Apple in terms of not just product launches but also prices of products. There\u2019s an affordable iPhone (SE), there\u2019s an affordable Watch (SE) and even when people were expecting the M1 MacBooks to be super expensive, Apple surprised them by not jacking up the price. The AirPods Max sheds that \u2018affordable\u2019 tag with aplomb and reminds people that Apple can, well, go back to being Apple as far as the prices are concerned. No more \u2018affordable\u2019 jazz \u2014 you have to pay the big bucks to get the best of Apple. What else does it have?Colours. Yes, there are five colour variants \u2014 silver, space gray, pink, sky blue and green that will further accentuate the design philosophy of Apple. A strong case for the Smart CaseAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the case which is already become a topic of memes, jokes on the internet. No other headphones case gives you the option to charge the headphones without taking them out. Apple has designed the case in such a way that one can charge the headphones without taking them out. The jokes might be funny but it could be Apple that laughs all the way to the bank. AirPods are already a big business but can they become 'max'?Since their launch in 2016, Apple AirPods have only gone strength to strength. Tech analyst Kevin Rooke in May 2020 pointed out that if Apple AirPods was a standalone business (founded 2016, $12 billion revenue, 125% growth, 30\u201350% margin), it would probably be the most valuable startup in the world. Further, as per Counterpoint Research, AirPods shipments will cross 100 million by the end of the year. The AirPods Max may just add to the volume and value of the Apple's business. Why does Apple think Rs 60,000 is \u2018worth\u2019 spending on a pair of headphones?Simply because the AirPods Max is the quintessential Apple product: they look great, have all the elements of Apple\u2019s design philosophy and cost a bomb. And as we have seen in the past, there are millions of takers of such Apple products.  ",

However, rumour has it that the company might announce one more product before the year ends. MacRumors has obtained this information via an internal memo from a reliable source that Apple has informed its AppleCare service providers to gear up for an upcoming change on Tuesday, December 8 at around 5:30am PT (7:00 pm IST). The internal memo is addressed to AppleCare technicians and asks them to prepare for an upcoming new product SKUs, new/updated product descriptions and new/updated product pricing. According to the MacRumors report, Apple released a similar memo for AppleCare before the launch of iPhone 12 and the time for that was 10 am PT which was also the time of the iPhone 12 event. Taking that into consideration, the company might hold an event to launch a new product on December 8 at 5:30am PT or silently launch a product via a press release just like it did with MacBook Pro and AirPods last year. Although, it is still unclear what product Apple might launch at the event, but we can assume that it could be the Apple tile-like tracking device rumourly known as AirTags.  ",

At the heart of Apple\u2019s health focused initiatives lies the Apple Watch. And it looks like the Watch is doing better than ever for the company. Apple has seen a new record when it comes to its Apple Watch Series, as the latest quarterly data by IDC shows that the company has sold a record high number of units in the third quarter of 2020. According to the new data from IDC Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, the Apple Watch shipments reached 11.8 million units. Last year in the same quarter, the company sold 6.8 million units, recording a 75% year-on-year growth. The IDC data suggests that the Apple Watch held 21.6% market share among wrist-worn wearables shipped worldwide last quarter, trailing in second behind Xiaomi's estimated 24.5% market share, but this includes everything from high-end smartwatches to basic fitness trackers like Xiaomi's Mi Band, which is priced under $50. When it comes to the overall wearable market, Apple emerged as the market leader with an estimated 41.4 million devices shipped, which includes AirPods and AirPods Pro. This is up from 29.8 million units of the same quarter last year making the company achieve a 38.6% annual growth. \"AirPods along with Apple Watches were hugely popular due to pandemic driven demand,\" IDC notes in its report. \"Apple's expanding Watch lineup also ensured that devices were available at multiple price points including new mid-level products such as the Watch SE.\" The global wearables industry continued to grow during the third quarter of 2020, as the market witnessed a 35.1% increase in the market year-over-year. In totality, the vendors shipped 125 million units in the third quarter of 2020. \u201cThe surge was driven by seasonality, new product launches, and the global pandemic. New products from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and others helped renew interest in popular categories such as smartwatches and hearables. Meanwhile, consumer spend on electronics also increased during recent months as spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities decreased. This shift in spending was another catalyst for the wearables market,\u201d added the report.  ",

Moreover, it has also been mentioned that there is a sudden gain in battery life after restarting their device. Older iPhone models such as the iPhone XS, iPhone 7, iPhone 6S, and first-generation iPhone SE appear to be the affected models. Even one iPad, the 2018 iPad Pro, also seems to be causing the same issue. So far, Apple hasn\u2019t acknowledged any such issue but if the software is causing the issue then an update is soon expected to be rolled to fix it. To recall, the iOS 14.2 was rolled out in November, along with iPadOS 14.2. Both iOS 14.2 and iPadOS 14.2 come with support for more than 100 new emojis that include animals, food, faces, household objects and others, along with eight new wallpapers that are compatible with mode light and dark modes of the device.

        "title": "Here's why Apple hasn't made matte Black MacBooks as yet ",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: When it comes to Apple MacBooks, the company has been following a pretty standard colour scheme and if you have ever wondered why the Cupertino-based tech giant has not yet chosen to manufacture Black-coloured MacBook then you have your answer today thanks to a new patent that has been spotted by Patently Apple filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and is titled as \u2018Anodized Part Having a Matte Black Appearance\u2019. \u201cEnclosures for portable electronic devices can include an anodized layer that can be dyed in different colors in order to enhance their cosmetic appeal to consumers. However, certain colors are far more difficult to achieve than others. In particular, attempts by consumer electronic device manufacturers to achieve a true black color have fallen short. Indeed, the best attempts have attained only a dark grey color. One challenge to achieving a true black color is that anodized metal can have a relatively high floss finish, which is capable of specularly reflecting large amounts of visible light,\u201d says the company in the patent. Apple goes on to describe the process in slightly more detail and says, \u201cMerely depositing dye particles within pores of an anodized layer is insufficient to impart a true black color. Indeed, the anodized layer plateaus at an L* value in the low 20s. Part of the challenge to achieving a true black color is that the surface of these enclosures generally has a high gloss finish, which contributes to specular reflection of a large amount of visible light.\u201d While a patent application is not supposed to be a clear indicator of whether or not Apple may be planning to launch a pure matte Black MacBook model in the future, but it does give a peek into how the company intends to do it in case it decides to give it a shot.

        "title": "2020: The year Apple found its mojo back in India ",
        "body": "It\u2019s not been a normal year by any measure as a global pandemic has been raging on impacting lives like never before. Perhaps in a rather perverse way it is fitting that Apple is not having a \u2018normal\u2019 year either in India. The Cupertino-based tech giant is on course to having one of its greatest ever years in a market that has proven to be a tough nut to crack. If analysts\u2019 estimates are to be believed, Apple will end the year with as many 2.5 million shipments of the iPhone in 2020. If Apple does hit that number then it would have sold the most iPhones in India since 2017. How 2020 shaped up for AppleApple began the first quarter on a high. As per Counterpoint Research, in the first quarter of 2020, Apple registered a 78% year-on-year growth in smartphone shipments. The growth was attributed to the strong sales of iPhone 11 and deals and discounts offered on sites like Amazon and Flipkart. In the premium segment, Apple commanded 55% market share, ahead of the likes of OnePlus and Samsung. During the second quarter \u2014 hit by the lockdown \u2014 Apple\u2019s market share was down to close to 49%, as per IDC. However, according to Canalys, iPhone shipments were close to 250,000 in the second quarter when overall smartphone shipments were down by 47%. Once again it was the iPhone 11 \u2014 along with iPhone XR \u2014 that helped Apple as two iPhones together accounted for 28% shipments in the premium segment. The launch of iPhone SE in April helped Apple make its presence felt in the mid-premium segment as well. In Q3, according to Canalys, Apple registered double-digit growth and sold close to 800,000 iPhone units. \u201cApple is finally paying attention to India,\u201d Canalys Research Director, Rushabh Doshi, had said at the time. \u201cIt has opened a direct online store, giving it several new angles in its go-to-market strategy, such as utilizing device trade-ins to provide purchase incentives, or bundling AirPods with iPhones to make them more appealing.\u201d The Apple Online store in India opened in September, so that really didn\u2019t give it a push but it was the strong sales of iPhone 11 which helped Apple. That\u2019s not to say that the Apple Online store hasn\u2019t helped as it is a big part of Apple\u2019s growth strategy in the country. Buying iPhones directly from Apple is a big plus for customers and Apple has been smart to offer deals like free AirPods with iPhone 11 during the festive period. Apple CEO Tim Cook during the quarterly investors\u2019 call also revealed that September quarter was a record setting one in India for the company. More than the iPhone for Apple in IndiaWhile the iPhone is the bread and butter for Apple in the country, other products too have been quite well. Counterpoint Research\u2019s data showed that Apple increased its share by 6% in the true wireless headphones market. Apple AirPods (2nd-gen) are the fifth best selling true wireless headphones in the country. Considering they start at Rs 14,999, it\u2019s quite remarkable as the leading brands like bOat, Xiaomi, Realme and JBL all operate in entry-level price segments mainly. The MacBook too has been doing quite well for Apple in India. According to IDC, Q3 was the best ever quarter for MacBook shipments in India as it grew by 19.4%. The road ahead for Apple in IndiaOverall, Apple still remains a \u2018small\u2019 player in India as Chinese brands like Oppo, Xiaomi, Realme, Vivo continue to dominate the market. Chinese brands have more than 75% overall market share in India. But in the premium space, 2020 has proven to be a great year for Apple. It has maintained its dominance and having an iPhone starting from Rs 40,000 (iPhone SE) to Rs 1.5 lakh (iPhone 12 Pro Max), it has an opportunity to cater to every kind of premium phone buyer. The iPhone has always been aspiration but unaffordable for most people. Not that it has become less expensive but there have been more choices for Indian consumers when it comes to iPhone.  ",

        "body": "Tech giant Apple has been made to compulsorily include the power adapter with the iPhone models sold in Sao Paolo, Brazil, as per a report by AppleInsider. The state consumer protection agency Procon-SP has compelled Apple to bundle the phone chargers with the iPhone 12 models if the customers request them, as per the report. After France, Sao Paolo seems to be the only place in the world where Apple is going to include the charger with the iPhone 12 purchase. Procon-SP, in a press release, stated that a charging brick is an \u201cessential part\u201d of using an iPhone or other such product that requires its use. It added that by not providing the charger with the new iPhones, Apple was in violation of the Brazilian Consumer Defense Code. According to the report, Procon-SP was not satisfied with the reason Apple stated for not giving the charger with the new iPhones. The reason, that since most of the Apple consumers already possess iPhone chargers, not giving extra chargers to them would help cut back carbon emissions, did not seem to have sat well with the agency. It has reasoned that the American tech giant has not made it clear in its marketing why it was discontinuing bundling the power adapter with the new iPhones. A similar case developed in France where Apple has been made to include the EarPods with the iPhone models. The company has announced in October that it would not be bundling the EarPods and the power adapters with its iPhones, saying that the decision would help the environment by reducing carbon emissions.

        "body": "Apple rolled out iOS 14.2 update for supported Apple iPhone models with a plethora of new features such as security fixes, performance enhancements, new wallpapers, emojis and more. But it didn\u2019t mention anything about the 1080p FaceTime video calls support in the iOS 14.2 update changelog. MacMagazine noted that Apple has silently updated the comparison page of iPhone 8 and newer models with 1080p FaceTime call support from 720p earlier. According to the comparison page, iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone XR, and iPhone 11 smartphones now support 1080p FaceTime video calls over Wi-Fi and 5G cellular connectivity. However, to be able to make 1080p FaceTime calls, both callers are supposed to have connected their compatible iPhone to a Wi-Fi connection or use 5G cellular network connection. MacMagazine also mentioned that the difference in the quality between 720p calls and 1080p calls is quite an upgrade over the previous 720p calls on 4G cellular connectivity. The reason why Apple decided not to include the feature in the update changelog of iOS 14.2. The only reason we can think of is the feature was earlier exclusive to iPhone 12 series which was recently launched and adding this feature will end the exclusivity for the newer iPhone models. Keeping all the speculation aside, the addition of 1080p FaceTime support is a nice little upgrade for users still using older iPhones.  ",

        "title": "Will Facebook be forced to break WhatsApp and Instagram ",
        "body": "Could Facebook be forced to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram? That's what the US government is seeking in a long-awaited antitrust lawsuit filed this week, the same day dozens of states sued the social media giant on similar grounds. Whatever happens, experts expect a long-drawn out battle that Facebook is prepared to defend vigorously -- and with enormous resources. Lawmakers of both major parties are also calling for stronger oversight of Facebook and other tech-industry giants. They argue that the companies' massive market power is out of control, crushing smaller competitors and endangering consumer privacy and choice. Facebook insists that its services provide useful benefits for users and that complaints about its power are misguided. Here are some questions and answers about what the government actions against Facebook mean. What happens next: The short answer is -- we waitThe battle initiated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the states could take years to resolve. At the moment, experts think it's unlikely to end in a settlement, so it may be a fight to the verdict. And the two sides could spend months arguing over issues such as document disclosure before the trial even starts. Once it does, expect a slugfest. Facebook has been ``well aware'' of the possibility for this antitrust challenge for some time and they have ``the resources to make this a formidable challenge for prosecutors,'' said George Hay, an antitrust expert and law professor at Cornell University. ``The one thing that is certain is that the demand for antitrust lawyers and economists will increase.'' Are Apple and Amazon next? Justice Department prosecutors are pursuing a separate antitrust case against Google, one that mirrors its case against Microsoft 20 years ago. Microsoft lost that one, although it escaped a breakup when an appellate court disagreed with the trial judge's order. It's possible that more cases could follow. Congressional investigators spent months digging into the actions of Apple and Amazon in addition to Facebook and Google, and called the CEOs of all four companies to testify. The FTC and the Justice Department reportedly have been investigating Amazon and Apple, respectively. So no one can rule out the possibility that three or even all four of these companies could end up in court. Why breakiing up Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook may not be easy Government prosecutors are asking for exactly that. But it could be harder than it sounds. The FTC argues that Facebook has engaged in a ``systematic strategy'' to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Facebook called the government's claims ``revisionist history'' that punishes successful businesses and noted that the FTC cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions years ago. That's true, although experts say it doesn't really matter -- at least not legally. The FTC approvals years ago don't preclude re-examining or even reversing those acquisitions. Still, it's complicated. ``It may be that, if the court agrees with the government's theory of the case, divestiture is the only way to cure the anticompetitive harm,'' said Daniel A. Lyons, a law professor and antitrust expert at Boston College. ``But courts traditionally break up companies only as a last resort, because unwinding two merged entities is difficult. In this case, it would involve undoing over a decade of integration.`` Facebook doesn't operate the three companies as separate businesses and has been integrating functions of Instagram and WhatsApp with its main platform. For instance, users can now access messages sent on either app in Facebook's Messenger app. What WhatsApp-Instagram breakup means for users In the short term: Probably not. In the medium-to-long term: Maybe. Any spinoff would involve undoing years of technical integration, and that's not easy to untangle. And a split would almost inevitably create issues that could annoy users, ranging from the loss of features added by Facebook to technical problems as engineers muck around with the apps' internal code. When Facebook bought Instagram, the photo-sharing app was a fraction of its current size, with just 30 million users; today is has well over 1 billion. It offered a simple app that users really liked, although it didn't make any money. Facebook has since added a bevy of new features, such as chats, disappearing ``stories'' and the ability to shop and create and watch longer videos. While some original Instagram users deride the additions, others have come to appreciate them -- and might miss them if they were to disappear. WhatsApp has stayed truer to its origins, although Facebook has big plans underway for the messaging app as well. For instance, shopping. Facebook argues that neither app would be where they are today if it hadn't thrown vast resources at expanding features, beefing up security and moderating content. But a post-breakup Facebook might be so busy trying to fill Instagram- and WhatsApp-sized holes that startups formerly under its shadow could spring up with their own innovative services. Which could be good for everyone. How Facebook still continues to growFacebook has 2.7 billion users, most of them outside of the US. In 2012, when it bought Instagram, it had 1 billion. While growth has slowed, nothing -- not privacy concerns, not abuse and misinformation, not criticisms about the giant's power and dominance, not even unproven claims about bias against conservatives -- have been able to reverse this trend. Even when people declare they are leaving Facebook, they often end up returning. And there are still enough people in the world, especially outside of the US and Europe, who join and make up for anyone who ``flounces.'' Of course, acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp has also helped Facebook fold more people into its ``family of apps.`` It's easy to join Facebook and not as easy to leave -- both technically and because everyone you know is on there, not to mention photos, memories and the ability to keep tabs on exes and former classmates.

All that the hacker needed to do was stay near your iPhone and exploit a vulnerability that affected AirDrop. Thankfully, there are no reported cases of someone exploiting this vulnerability and the zero-day exploit has been patched. Apple released the patch in iOS 13.5 update and if you are using an iOS version that is above 13.5, you are safe.

Hackers could gain access to your data by simply being within the Wi-Fi radius of your iOS device. The user is not required to click on any link or perform any task that would help the hackers. \u201cWith some proper engineering and better hardware, once AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) is enabled the entire exploit could run in a handful of seconds. There are likely also better techniques for getting AWDL enabled in the first place rather than the hash bruteforce. My goal was to build a compelling demo of what can be achieved by one person, with no special resources, and I hope I've achieved that,\u201d explained Ian Beer of Project Zero in a blog post.

The implant has full access to the user's personal data, including emails, photos, messages, keychain and so on. The attacker demonstrates this by stealing the most recently taken photo. Delivery of the implant takes around two minutes, but with more engineering investment there's no reason this prototype couldn't be optimized to deliver the implant in a handful of seconds,\u201d he said.

Wait omg if you like a tweet with #BlackIsKing there\u2019s a new animation for the like button \ud83d\ude33 https://t.co/TlwfvNr8Tj\u2014 Skye (@bhyunster) 1596232408000Disney was the first to introduce this sorcery on Twitter with the Black is King hashtag. In July, Twitter users were amazed to see a \u201clion effect\u201d the moment they liked any tweet with the Black is King hashtag. NASA followed Disney to showcase a cute animated rocket with the #CountdownToMars hashtag to celebrate the rover launch to Mars. Later, NBA followed by adding a bouncing basketball with #WholeNewgame hashtag. Now, the \u2018sorcery\u2019 behind this animated like button was clear. Any brand can get a special like button by paying Twitter. Twitter calls this Branded Likes. In fact, it is one of the coolest things that Twitter had to offer in 2020. And this promotional feature has even excited brands. Yo this is dope.likes and retweet have animation. Like and retweet to see magic #AppleEvent https://t.co/8xQxdicxJH\u2014 Sulekha (@hiddeniris02) 1602649574000While Disney, NASA and NBA were the first to try out Branded Likes, it was Apple that spread the word to the world. In fact, Apple continued with the Branded Like button for other events as well. Recently, Red Bull also joined the new promotional feature offered by Twitter. But it was slightly different. To see the Red Bull can animation, people had to copy-paste \u201c#\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30d6\u30eb\u201d on any tweet and hit the like button. Now what is \u201c\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30d6\u30eb\u201d? It\u2019s simply Red Bull written in Japanese. Twitter is currently offering Branded Likes in the US and Japan which explains why Red Bull opted for \u201c\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30d6\u30eb\u201d. like dis post for a surprise \ud83d\udc40#\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30d6\u30eb https://t.co/Tcp4FtfszC\u2014 Red Bull (@redbull) 1606821657000Twitter has always been considered as a serious social media platform where most trending conversations are anything but peaceful. This makes it rather tricky for companies to advertise on Twitter and get some meaningful engagements. Also, it is difficult for brands to make people hit the like button or engage with the brand on promoted tweets. But the new Branded Likes promotional feature offers a much needed breather and some harmless brand engagement. Twitter hasn\u2019t officially disclosed how much it costs to get a Branded Like button. But given the excitement around it, we may expect more brands to opt for it in 2021 when Twitter allows brands from more countries to promote the like button. Of course, too much of something may spoil the fun altogether and bidding the right price for the branded like button may strain social media budgets but to get real people willingly hit the like button and drive the brand\u2019s \u201ccoolness factor\u201d Twitter may have just found the right solution.

        "body": "Apple may launch a new iPad Pro lineup in 2021 with OLED displays. With OLED screens, you can expect better brightness and colours on the upcoming iPad Pro. Apple is already said to be moving its iPad family to mini-LED screens and both LG Displays and Samsung are developing new OLED screens for the upcoming iPad Pro models as per a report by TheElec. Apple has been using LCD displays or Liquid Retina screens for the iPad Pro range and now it may be time for upgrading the display. The report claimed that Samsung Display is upgrading its production line to make the new OLED screens for iPad. Samsung is reportedly \u201cadding a distribution chamber to the origin material deposition chamber to deposit red, green, and blue in tandem.\u201d This will allow Samsung to create a new OLED structure which will ensure that the display panel lasts longer on the iPad Pro. Meanwhile, Apple is also relying on Samsung for the foldable display panel to create its first foldable iPhone by 2022. Apple is reportedly gearing up to launch its first foldable iPhone in 2020 and is said to be in talks with suppliers in Taiwan like Hon Hai and Nippon Nippon. Hon Hai is one of the main suppliers and it is expected to be \u201cmost important assembly plant for Apple's first folding mobile phone\u201d. Apple may use OLED or MicroLED panels for the first foldable iPhone. Apart from the foldable display, Apple will be introducing a special type of bearing or hinge mechanism for the foldable iPhone. It\u2019s supplier Nippon Nippon is working on creating the same.  ",

        "title": "Uninstall Flash Player immediately from your computer: Adobe ",
        "body": "Adobe is reminding users that it will stop supporting Flash Player after December 31, 2020. Even if you want to access Flash content you will not be able to do so as the company said that it will block games and animations based on Flash from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021. Keeping Flash Player on your system after December 2020 is risky and the company is recommending all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems. Adobe had first announced that it is killing Flash in July 2017. \u201cFlash Player may remain on your system unless you uninstall it. Uninstalling Flash Player will help secure your system since Adobe does not intend to issue Flash Player updates or security patches after the EOL Date. Adobe will block Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021 and the major browser vendors will continue to disable Flash Player from running after the EOL Date,\u201d said the company. Adobe suggests not to use third party versions of Flash player. \u201cThese versions of Flash Player are not authorized by Adobe. Users should not use unauthorized versions of Flash Player. Unauthorized downloads are a common source of malware and viruses,\u201d warned Adobe. In fact, even Apple got fooled by illegal Adobe Flash player versions. Apple approved a common malware that mostly spreads as an update for Adobe Flash Player. Apple mistook the malware for a legitimate app and allowed people to download it and even run it despite having \u201cnotarization\u201d check in place. So, what\u2019s notarization? Apple had introduced notarization in macOS 10.15 aka Catalina and this allowed Apple to check the authenticity of a macOS app before it is distributed to Mac users on the app store. In other words, Apple wanted to win the trust of users by saying that if you are able to download and install an app on your Mac, then the app is legit and you need not worry. However, developers were able to bypass this by hiding a Shlayer trojan downloader in an app which appeared like an update to Adobe Flash Players and Apple even approved it.  ",

        "body": "When Apple took the decision of not including a charging adapter with its iPhones, Samsung was one of the first ones to mock the iPhone-maker. However, it now appears that the South Korean tech giant is set to join its arch-rival on this particular matter. According to a report by Brazilian website Tecnoblog, the upcoming flagship models from Samsung \u2014 Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra \u2014 have been certified by ANATEL in Brazil sporting model numbers SM-G991B/DS, SM-G996B/DS, and SM-G998B/DS, respectively. None of the said handsets are going to include a power adapter in the box, claims the report. To recall, after Apple announced its decision to not only skip power adapters for the new iPhone 12 series, but also for its previous models as well, Samsung posted on Facebook an image of a Galaxy charger with a simple message, \u201cincluded with your Galaxy\u201d. The post read, \u201cYour #Galaxy does give you what you are looking for. From the most basic as a charger, to the best camera, battery, performance, memory and even 120Hz screen on a smartphone.\u201d Interestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Samsung will be doing the same thing, it has mocked Apple for first. When Apple launched the iPhone 7, it ditched the headphone jack and a similar furore was created like the non-inclusion of charger has. Samsung was quick to mock Apple in a series of ads about having headphone jack in its phones. It also made fun of a dongle which the iPhone required to plug in a headphone jack. However, the company soon ditched the headphone jack from its phones and even introduced a dongle. What it also did was completely remove the ads making fun of Apple from its social media channels.

        "title": "Why you may want to wait before buying new MacBooks with M1 chip ",
        "body": "Apple has introduced its own M1 chip to run MacBooks and the new Mac Mini. While the new chip boasts better performance, battery life and thermal efficiency, it would be a good idea to wait for a while before rushing to buy a new MacBook Air or Pro with M1 chip. This is because you can only experience the claimed performance if you are able to get new macOS apps that are compatible with Apple\u2019s new chip. For example, even Google is releasing a new Chrome browser for Apple devices with M1 chip. Microsoft, Adobe and other big software players will release M1 chip compatible macOS apps but it is too early to comment about the actual performance of these apps. So, before you get all excited, understand that it would take some time for Apple and other developers to join hands together to unleash the true potential of M1 chips. There\u2019s another issue at hand. MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini with M1 chip are facing Bluetooth connectivity issues. Users are reportedly having troubles connecting their Bluetooth devices to the new Mac. While using third-party Bluetooth devices may be a trouble at this point of time, even Apple\u2019s own Bluetooth mouse, keyboard and AirPods are sometimes facing connectivity issues. Apple is yet to acknowledge this. Users took to Reddit to highlight Bluetooth issues with Mac Mini. A user said, \u201cI have three M1 computers, two Mini's and a pro. All three have the issue with a new apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The mouse and keyboard worked for months for me on my old macbook pro and I even had the big sur beta software with no issues. I did everything I could to fix the issue, there is a bug with the new processor for sure. I'll wait till they figure it out.\u201d It is quite tempting to buy the latest Apple Macs with M1 chip. Having said that if you think your work will be affected by Bluetooth connectivity issues or if there\u2019s any app you use that is not yet optimised for Apple\u2019s M1 chip then it may be a good idea to wait before dumping your Mac with Intel inside.

        "body": "Apple Inc's security chief on Monday was indicted on bribery charges as prosecutors alleged he promised a donation of 200 iPads to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office to secure four concealed-weapon permits for Apple employees. The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office said a grand jury indicted Apple Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, 50, and two officers in the Sheriff's Office. The officers were charged with soliciting bribes for issuing concealed carry permits. Carrying concealed firearms in California is illegal without a permit, and county sheriffs have broad discretion over their issuance. Moyer's attorney said he was innocent of the charges. Apple said it had conducted its own investigation and found no wrongdoing. The indictments came amid an ongoing corruption probe by the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office into the Sheriff's Office over allegations that contributions to Sheriff Laurie Smith's 2018 re-election campaign were exchanged for concealed weapons permits. That case did not involve Apple. Moyer's attorney, Ed Swanson, said Moyer had applied for weapons permits for some Apple security personnel to protect executives and employees after shootings at other Silicon Valley tech firms, such as a 2018 incident at YouTube's headquarters. \"They went through the process the way you're supposed to do it,\" he said of the permit applications, adding that the iPad donation was unconnected to the permits. \"There was no bribe, no quid pro quo.\"  ",

As per latest numbers revealed in IDC\u2019s research report, Apple MacBook shipments grew 19.4% YoY as it ended its biggest quarter of shipments in the country. This comes hot on heels after Apple set its best ever September quarter record in the country. It\u2019s not just in India but Apple\u2019s MacBook seem to be on a roll across the world. A report by Strategy Analytics suggests that Apple has \u201coutperformed\u201d the market average. Globally, notebook shipments increased by 34% whereas Apple saw its shipments grow by 39%. The report by Strategy Analytics reveals that Apple sold about 6 million MacBooks in the September quarter. Last year, in the same quarter Apple had shipped close to 4.3 million MacBooks. However, even with this growth Apple remains the fourth largest player in the global notebook market. HP and Lenovo lead the market with 23.6% whereas Dell is third with 13.7% market share. Apple is the fourth biggest player with 9.7% market share.

Commenting on current demand for consumer PCs, Bharath Shenoy, market analyst for PC Devices at IDC India states, \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty if and when will the schools and colleges return to physical classrooms at full strength. This is forcing students to manage all their learning virtually. This demand is expected to stay strong as India remains underpenetrated in PCs. To add to this, the growing broadband connectivity in the country is making online learning easier for students. Hence, this opportunity will continue to be relevant for PC vendors for at least a few more quarters.\u201d Apple recently launched its new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro which will be powered by its own M1 processor.
